Ideascube is a content portal offering digital documentary resources (books, multimedia files, videos), websites (Wikipedia, the Gutenberg project, Wikisource) and initial and further training tools (Moocs) that can be viewed off-line. Once on-line, the KoomBook can update resources already installed and upload new ones. Ideascube is the software from which the KoomBook operates.
