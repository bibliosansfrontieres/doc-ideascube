Before you can access and browse the available options you have on the graphical user interface of the ideas box Server, you must connect to the server

This is done through:

- Search for a wireless hotspot that refer to the IDB server 
- Connect to this network by the same way you connect to any other wireless network and dont forget you need the credintal number for that 
- Go to the web browser, prefer to use the browser firefox as the percentage of information security is higher than other browsers
- Through the URL bar, and enter the URL of the server: ** ideasbox.lan **, then you will be redirected to the graphical interface of the server and you can browse all the options available for you.

** Note **
If you facing any problem with accessing the site through the URL ** ideasbox.lan** , you must make sure that you are connected to the server's wireless network, and that the address begins with ** http://ideasbox.lan **
