title: 'Connecting to the Server'
---

Before you can access and browse the available options of the Ideas Box Server, you must connect to it.

This is done through the following steps:

- Search for a wireless hotspot that refers to the IDB server 
- Connect to this network the same way you connect to any other wireless network.  Don't forget you need the credential number. 
- Go to the web browser.  We prefer to use Firefox as its percentage of information security is higher than other browsers
- In the URL bar, enter the URL of the server: **ideasbox.lan**. You will be redirected to the graphical interface of the server and you can browse all the options available for you.

** Note **
If you have a problem with accessing the site through the URL **ideasbox.lan**, make sure that you are connected to the server's wireless network, and that the address begins with ** http://ideasbox.lan **
