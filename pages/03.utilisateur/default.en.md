## Media center

![](menu_mediacenter.jpg)

The Media Center groups together all types of media files:

* Images
* Videos
* Pdf files
* Sound files
* Text files
* Epubs
* IT applications

These contents can be tagged so they can be found quickly.

You can also use filters per file type, in order to display only images or videos for example.

## The Library

![](bibliotheque.jpg)

Ideascube includes a book administration application. _Please note, this application is not available on KoomBooks, as they do not systematically include paper books._

The Library application allows you to browse through all the books available in the Ideas Box, both paper and digital books.

The Library is used to manage all the books in the Ideas Box, whether paper or digital. It allows users to browse the collection of books, do searches for titles or authors, and to sort books by title, date added, author and language.
