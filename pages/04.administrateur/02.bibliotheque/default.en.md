Administrators are able to create, modify and remove books and to add copies for each of the books created.

## Books and copies

To use the Library application, you must understand the difference between a book and a copy. The book is equivalent to a concept, while the copy is the object. A book can be associated with one or more copies. It is possible to have more than one copy of a book in a library. If no copy has been created for a book, the book will not appear in the library.

## Creating books

You must create a book before creating a copy. To do this in the Library application, click on the Create a book button. Please note: this button only appears if you are signed in as an Administrator.

The book is therefore a description including the title, the author, the ISBN number, cover picture, series, summary, sub-title, publishing house, a category (adult, children, theatre, novel, etc.), a language and tags.

## Creating copies

Once the book is created, you can assign one or more copies to it. To do so, click on the book, and click on the button "Add a copy ". _Please note: this button only appears if you are signed in as an Administrator._

A copy is given a barcode, comments (to state the condition of the book copy or any other useful information), a location if it is a paper book, a file to be uploaded if it is a digital book.

## Book loans

By creating a copy and entering the barcode related to a book, you can manage book loans in the PrÃªt (Loan) application.

## Importing books

You can import several books in one batch in the Library via the "import notices" option. You can import four types of catalogue files:

- a catalogue from another Ideas Box or KoomBook in Ideascube format import using book - ISBN numbers
- csv files from [Moccam en ligne](http://www.moccam-en-ligne.fr/)
- a catalogue in unimarc format

We recommend the first two options: importing from a catalogue in Ideascube format or importing using ISBN numbers.

To import from a catalogue in Ideascube format: select the option "zip ideascube", click on browse to select the zip file then click on "Charger des notices depuis un fichier" (Load notices from a file). This option is only useful if you wish to import a catalogue from another Ideascube software. An export from Ideascube must be completed prior to this. This is done via the option "export a catalogue". The export is in zip file format.

To import books using their ISBN number: enter the files in the fields of the "From ISBN" form. This option only works when connected to the Internet as data is recovered from the [http://openlibrary.org/](http://openlibrary.org/) website. We strongly recommend that Ideascube users enter the notices of books which are not directly available on [http://openlibrary.org/](http://openlibrary.org/) and then restart the import. In this way, these new notices will be available to the entire Ideascube user community and the openlibrary.org community.

The import creates book notices. For each book created, you must then create a copy and enter the barcode related to the book.
