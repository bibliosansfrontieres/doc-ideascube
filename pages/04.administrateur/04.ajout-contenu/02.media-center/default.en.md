To add new media, you must first go to the **Media Center section**.

Once signed in as Administrator, a new menu appears on the right of the screen: **Add a document.**

The Media section is used to import the following types of media files:

- Images
- Videos
- Pdf files
- Sound files
- Text files
- Epubs
- IT applications

Tags can be used to sort media files by area of interest, making it easier to create a collection of documents on a particular theme!
