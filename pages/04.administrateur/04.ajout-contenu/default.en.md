title: 'Adding Content in the Media Center'
---

There are three methods to add content to the Media Center of the Ideascube.

* [Upload a File Manually](media-center/)
* [Manually Download a Content Package](telechargement-manuel-de-paquet/)
* [Mass Import via CSV files](import-csv/)

Each method has the same result of adding content to the media center.  However, the only one that is simple and accessible for all is the **Upload a File Manually** uption.  The other two require some online skills and knowledge of linux commands.
