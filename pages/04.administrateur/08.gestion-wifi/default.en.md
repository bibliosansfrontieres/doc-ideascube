# Managing WI-FI

The KoomBook is able to connect to an existing WI-FI network if you do not have an Ethernet cable.

**This function enables you to:**

- Update the KoomBook (which automatically uploads updates when connected to the Internet)
- Act as a bridge with the Internet while remaining connected to the KoomBook and accessing your applications within it.

##Â Connecting to a WI-FI network

Click on the WI-FI network you wish to connect to. If this network is private (little black padlock), a password is required.

Once a hotspot is configured, it is stored in the memory for future use. No passwords will be requested when connecting. To delete the network, click on History.
