# Stopping the device

The **STOP/RESTART** function appears when you are connected as an Administrator. This is the only way to stop the device. 

Click on one of the two buttons to make your choice.

We recommend that you **do not force shutdown** via the push button. If you do so, you may cause permanent damage to the deviceâ€™s operating system.

The KoomBook is completely shut down after the blue LED goes off.
