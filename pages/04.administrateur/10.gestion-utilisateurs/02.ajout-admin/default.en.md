### Step 1

In the main window of the user admin section, click on the user for whom you wish to change the status. 

Here, for example, we are going to change the status of the **admin** account. Click on the **admin** link.

### Step 2

In the right-hand menu, click on **Add to team members**

Your user now enjoys administrator rights.
