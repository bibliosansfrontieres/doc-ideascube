This section is used to create, modify or remove users. Each user with “staff” status is granted blog and media admin rights.

## Adding a new user

Click in the right-hand menu on **Add a user** then enter:

- **Serial**: the user’s username
- **Full name**: the user’s full name

In the right-hand menu, click on **Set password** to add a password to the user you have just created. In the right-hand menu, click on **Add staff status** to add administrator rights.

## Adding administrator rights to a user

If you have created a standard user (with no specific rights), you may want to grant new rights so that the user can, for example, add content to the Media Center.
