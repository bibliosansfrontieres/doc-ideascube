This section is used to create, modify or remove users. Each user with “staff” status is granted blog and media admin rights.

## Adding a New User

Click on **Add a user** in the right-hand menu, then enter:

- **Serial**: the user’s username
- **Full name**: the user’s full name

In the right-hand menu, click on **Set password** to add a password to the user you have just created. In the right-hand menu, click on **Add staff status** to add administrator rights.

## Adding Administrator Rights to a User

If you have created a standard user (with no specific rights), you may want to grant new rights so that the user can, for example, add content to the Media Center.

>>>>>>To create a strong password, forget passwords and look for passphrases instead. For example: "The boat floats on the river" is a good passphrase that is easy to remember. Now, select your own passphrase!
